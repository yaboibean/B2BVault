TL;DR: The 2025 B2B Buyer First Report finds that B2B SaaS companies have made only marginal progress in adopting buyer-first practices like transparent pricing, interactive demos, and instant scheduling. Buyers continue to express a strong preference for easy access to product information, direct scheduling, and pricing transparency, but companies remain hesitant to fully implement these features due to a lack of clear data on ROI.

The report evaluates the websites and sales processes of the 100 top B2B SaaS companies, revealing that the adoption of buyer-first practices has stagnated, with only slight year-over-year improvements. Specifically, just 9 percent of companies offer calendar schedulers for instant meetings, 33 percent provide interactive demos, and 72 percent display a pricing page. The analysis draws on website reviews, demo bookings, and in-depth interviews with senior SaaS buyers, highlighting a disconnect between what buyers want and what companies deliver. Buyers consistently indicate they value the ability to see and interact with a product independently, schedule meetings instantly, and access transparent pricing. However, many companies are still reluctant to implement these practices, often citing a lack of hard data to justify the changes. The report also identifies key metrics for measuring the impact of buyer-first practices, such as website conversion rate, product engagement rate, demos scheduled from qualified leads, demo attendance rate, and the conversion rate from sales-qualified leads to opportunities. Real-world buyer feedback emphasizes the importance of reducing friction in the buying process, including removing unnecessary forms, providing clear product tours, and making pricing visible upfront.

Key takeaways and insights:
